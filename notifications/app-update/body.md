.

> **Release 2.4.14**

Sometimes when the answer contained accented characters, the character panel did not work properly and clearly indicated the correct answer to the user.  
2- The embedded keyboard of the open-ended question-answer becomes even more smart and makes the difference between ASCII character response, numerical, accentuated and mathematical calculation.  

.

With this version, the embedded keyboard that allows quick entry of open-ended question becomes even more smart:  
1- Now, when the answer is entirely numeric, the keyboard also proposes the symbols of addition, subtraction and semicolon (+, -,.)  
2- When the answer to the open question contains non-ASCII characters, the character panel is filtered so that it does not contain any ASCII character?  
3- The panel of characters proposed for open-ended question answers is now filtered to avoid repetition of characters.

.

> **Release 2.4.10**  
With this release, we have made many good updates, improvements and stability fixes.

>Now, if the application stops unexpectedly while you have a quiz editing work not yet saved; the next time you open your work, the application will offer to restore your work at is last known state before continuing.  
This is intended to prevent loss of unsaved questions during editing after an unintentional or unexpected shutdown of the app.

   5-Reopen QuizMaker and go to edit the quiz project you have closed unexpectedly previously
