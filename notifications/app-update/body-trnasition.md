With this release, we have made many good updates, improvements and stability fixes.  
However, the better part is concerning the issue of loss of Q&A when unexpected error happen during editing.  

>Now, if the application stops unexpectedly while you have a quiz editing work not yet saved; the next time you open your work, the application will offer to restore your work at is last known state before continuing.  
This is intended to prevent loss of unsaved questions during editing after an unintentional or unexpected shutdown of the app.

   1-Insure your to update or to dispose of the latest release 2.4.10 or higher  
   2-open your quiz project question editor and start to type some question and answers label.  
   4-From your Android OS button, open the task manager an kill app QuizMaker  
   5-Reopen QuizMaker and go to edit the quiz project you have closed unexpectedly previously  
   6-App will warn you that an unsaved work is pending and will suggest you to restore it.
