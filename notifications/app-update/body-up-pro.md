#### A new release is now available !
This new release brings important fixes to insure you a better experience using QuizMaker professional :  

* 1- sometimes the **scores** corresponding to the question of type **"put in order"** and **"match column"** were **not correctly** assigned even when  proposals were correctly ordered.  

* 2- When viewing the **correction** of questions of type **"enumeration"**, the system now allows you to better visualize your errors by prefixing the correction with <**~**> or <**-**> depending on whether or not you list this answer during exercise.
