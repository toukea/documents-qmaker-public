### 1- Multi selections in challenge mode !
Do you know the challenge mode? If yes, you must have been aware of the limitation of response proposals to only 4 with only one true proposal!

From now on, with this new version, there will be no more limits when the number of response proposals displayable in challenge mode.  
Thus, the application will now be able to display as many response proposals as you want, exactly as in exam mode games.

However, if you want to keep this limitation for your quizzes, you can always activate or deactivate this limitation manually.  
For more details on the configuration linked to the limitation of response options in challenge mode, you can have a [look here][details_compatv3].

### 2- Improvement of the coloring system in correction mode!
![image][image_correction_colours_code]  

We have redesigned the coloring system when correcting the selection questions to allow you to better distinguish between good and bad answers. So you will now have:  
><font color="#48a459">Dark green:</font> 
You have selected the correct answer.

><font color="#E53935">Red:</font>
You have selected the wrong answer.

><font color="#009688">Light green:</font>
You failed to select this answer when it was a correct answer.  

From now on, whether you play in challenge mode or in exam mode, during the correction phase of selection type questions, you will be entitled to this new coloring system.

### 3- Choose the game mode to test your creation!
![image][image_play_using]  

Now, from the question-answer editor, you can directly choose in which game mode to test your creation: exam or challenge.  

To do so, after clicking on the save icon, select the option "save and play using"; then choose the mode in which you want to test your creation.

### 4- Exclusively in the pro version !
As you probably know, the QuizMaker app is distributed into **two (2)** different distributions: The [standard][GooglePlay] edition which is totally free and the [professional][GooglePlayPro] edition which is not free.  
Thus, concerning the QuizMaker [professional][GooglePlayPro] edition, we have made updates that may interest you.  

* A) More flexible license formula:  
>Exclusively in the pro version, we have added a monthly billing system in addition to the existing annual license system.  
You can choose the one that suits you best if you have not yet purchased a Premium license.  


* B)  An additional advanced configuration for your questions and answers:
> 
Indeed, for selection type questions, we have improved the way you can configure the randomization of response proposals.
Now, when you activate the **"Always randomize"** mode, the application will allow you to adjust two additional parameters:  
>>1- The maximum number of proposals to display during the execution  
>>2- The maximum number of true propositions to display during the exercise.  
>>.

 >Thus, you could for example have a question with 10 propositions in total and containing 3 correct answers then ask the system during the randomization to select a maximum of only 5 answers with only 2 true propositions during the execution of the test.
