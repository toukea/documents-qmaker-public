### What has been translated?
We have translated all usual and important text contained inside the app so that it will be more easy for you to read text label, description and instructions in your mother tongue.  
Indeed, most part and text of the app are now available in portuguese.  

However some text containing inside some of your already edited or exported quiz could be still in english.  
To get this text in portuguese, you have just to edit your quiz section again and it will become in portuguese.  
It is for example the case for scoring policy property that may have an english label if created with app version "Levelup" or upper.  
You will just have to reedit this property to turn it in portuguese.  

The good news is that all your newest creation will be automatically turned totally in portuguese language.  
Also, note that, sometimes, you may receive remote notification in english ; these notification is sent by our remote server. They will be translated step by step in to offer you an even better experience.  
Let enjoy, please update for a better experience.
