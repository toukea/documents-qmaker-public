Indeed, these last months, we have worked to improve the app and to fix reported malfunctions.

![image update][image_media_answer]  
Indeed, you are now able to add media such as pictures and sounds individually into each answer proposal when creating question of type:  
* Selection
* Fill in the blanks
* Put in order
* Match columns  

To add media as answer proposal, you have to click on the menu at the left side of each answer proposal to get the media editor popup menu.  
Thus, more than simply adding text as answer proposal, you can also add images and sounds.  
You can even add it all both image and sound in same time or choose to add as answer proposal either a simple text, an image or an audio.  
Please take a look at indication as shown above.

### 2- Fixes and improvements!
The major improvements for this new release concern the edition saving system.
As user, you have reported to us that sometimes, when you quizzes start to contain pleinty of data, the app was started to behave badly and not responding quickly.  
With this new update, we have modified the edition saving system to avoid the app to lose fluidity or being stuck during saving process.  
Now, even when a quiz will contains a huge amount of data, the app will just invite you to wait a wille rather than crashing or not responding.  

In addition to the main improvements mentioned above, we have also made some other minor improvements and fixed app dysfunctions in order to improve your experience in general.

Do not hesitate to write to us by Email if you encounter problems that you would like to have resolved.
