### No more limitation of the number of proposed responses from the version 2.6.0!
From version 2.6.0, it is now possible to have an infinite number of response options in challenge mode.  

In fact, in versions prior to 2.6.0, there was a limitation when the number of display responses available in challenge mode for selection type questions :   
>* Four (4) Maximum Response Proposals Per Exercise During The Test
* A single true answer proposition randomly selected from the **"true"** propositions of the exercise.

Thus, from version **2.6.0 and higher**, there will no longer be a limit when the number of response proposals displayable in challenge mode. The application will now be able to display as many response suggestions as you want, just as in exam mode games.

However, if you want to keep this limitation for your quizzes, you can always **activate** or **deactivate** this **limitation** manually.
