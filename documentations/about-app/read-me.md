<b>What is a *.qcm file?</b>
<br/>

<br/>
â€¢A Qcm file is a compressed file that contains a set of questions, proposals, and answers.
<br/>
â€¢The structure of the files *.qcm makes it possible to embark among others multimedia contents such as images and sounds.
<br/>
â€¢Each *.qcm file is structured so that it is interpreted automatically by any compatible application.

<br/>
<b>Therefore;</b> Once you share a quiz as portable and shareable <b>QCM file format</b>, the receiver needs to have QuizMaker app installed or at least a compatible QCM file reader in order to read and play it.
Indeed, QCM file format is like any other file format, it needs a compatible reader to be read and interpreted.
<br/>
For example same as you need MSWord to read DOC file, MSExcel for XLS file or even a PDF reader to read a PDF file, you also need a QCM file reader to read QCM file format as does <b>this app</b> and all apps with Q-maker technology capability.
